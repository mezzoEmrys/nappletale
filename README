# Napple Tale Resource

Napple Tale is a cute platforming RPG for the Dreamcast, designed by a team of mostly women, with excellent music by Yoko Kanno.

This node project is meant to be a simple webserver that can be run locally to provide a quick reference to various aspects of the game that are useful for routing in speedruns, races, etc.

Website Goals:
global search feature, type in a name and it pops up with whatever matches
paffet panel with quest and MIS info
MIS panel with item/area info
quest panel with relevant info
maps of each area, with indicators for chests, drops, quest npcs
screenshots of MIS locations for each decode (in item panel?)

/data

paffet.json - contains paffet names and recipes
item.json - contains decodable items and their MIS
mis.json - contains all MIS
area.json - contains each explorable area, along with which items and recipes can be found there (TODO)
quest.json - contains each quest, with paffets required, requirements, and blockers (TODO)



General Napple Tale Goals:
Napple Tale Randomizer - Maybe we randomize paffet MIS? Item MIS? Enemy Drops? 
Fix Porch's Memo in the Translation Patch - Turns out this could be useful???
Bingo config by rules - if you say "no quests more than x deep", generates bingo config accordingly, also can turn on/off gatcha, etc.
No Dove Clock / More Dove Clock - ROM patches to either remove dove clock or add it to more scenes (low priority)

Randomizer Notes:
MIS pool for paffets, items
Enemizer
fucked up quest prerequisites (eg. winter petal for the wind to work in Wild Wind)
More Dove Clock Randomizer setting - deliver a pox unto your house
